"Water Plants Wisely: Water plants during the cooler parts of the day to reduce evaporation.",
"Use a Rain Barrel: Collect rainwater and use it to water your plants.",
"Take Shorter Showers: Reducing your shower time can save a lot of water.",
"Install a Dual-Flush Toilet: These toilets have two flush options - a half flush for liquid waste and a full flush for solid waste.",
"Reuse Greywater: If itâ€™s safe and legal in your area, reuse greywater for things like watering plants or flushing toilets.",
"Use a Broom, Not a Hose: Use a broom to clean driveways, sidewalks, and patios rather than hosing them down.",
